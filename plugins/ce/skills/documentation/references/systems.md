# Technical Documentation

For writing style, tone, and voice guidance, use `Skill(ce:writer)` with **The Engineer** persona.

## Core Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure

Reveal information in layers:

| Layer | Content | User Question |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | One-sentence description | What is it? |
| 2 | Quick start code block | How do I use it? |
| 3 | Full API reference | What are my options? |
| 4 | Architecture deep dive | How does it work? |

**Warnings, breaking changes, and prerequisites go at the TOP.**

### 2. Task-Oriented Writing

```markdown
<!-- Bad: Feature-oriented -->
## AuthService Class
The AuthService class provides authentication methods...

<!-- Good: Task-oriented -->
## Authenticating Users
To authenticate a user, call login() with credentials:
```

### 3. Show, Don't Tell

Every concept needs a concrete example.

## Formatting Standards

- **Sentence case headings**: "Getting started" not "Getting Started"
- **Max 3 heading levels**: Deeper means split the doc
- **Always specify language** in code blocks
- **Relative paths** for internal links
- **Tables** for structured data with 3+ attributes

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Code examples tested and runnable
- [ ] No placeholder text or TODOs
- [ ] Matches actual code behavior
- [ ] Scannable without reading everything
- [ ] Reader knows what to do next

## Anti-Patterns

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Wall of text | Break up with headings, bullets, code, tables |
| Buried critical info | Warnings/breaking changes at TOP |
| Missing error docs | Always document what can go wrong |

## Templates

For README, API endpoint, and file organization templates, see [templates.md](templates.md).
